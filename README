Welcome
----------

This repo is to help with the setup of an amenable BASH environment.
This effort was borne from the fact that I often find that I am on a
foriegn or new machine that I have to quickly setup and do work on.
Having a cogent and customized environment is key to working
effectively. So, this is an effort to create such an environment in a
way that is flexible for others to perhaps get use from.  Leveraging
GIT seemed like the right thing to do.

In this repo you will find the .bash* scripts necessary to set up your
BASH environment.  I code for a living so the environment is of a
distinctly developer ilk. I have included an install "setup" script to
do the installation and have functions to help keep things up-to-date.
My friends thus far enjoy it and I hope you will too.

Some goodies: The prompt changes when you are in a GIT repo to give
you some nice status information to help you navigate around in "the Z
- repo" axis.  Great for GIT users / developers!

There is a fair amount of gratuitous tom-foolery regarding the initial
shell welcome output (hope you are a fan of ascii-art fonts ;-)).
It's all in good fun!

----------

(smile)

Both ezsetup and setup have options that are described via --help | -h

Once you have this installed, you may put an additional customizations in file:

 ~/.bash_local

This file is sourced at the end of the load sequence.

----------
UPDATING:
----------

To make it easy to stay updated with the latest changes, there is a function to call.
Regardless of where you are located in the file system you can always call:

%> check_for_bash_resources_update

This will update this project from the git repository and branch that the project is locally at.

I should have done this a long time ago... enjoy! :-)
